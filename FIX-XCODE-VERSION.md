# 🚨 Fix for TestFlight Submission Error

## ❌ The Problem

Your app was built with an older iOS SDK. Apple now requires:
- **Xcode 16 or later**
- **iOS 18 SDK**
- **As of April 24, 2025**

## ✅ The Solution

You need to rebuild your app with the correct SDK version. Here's how:

### Option 1: Update EAS Build Configuration (Recommended)

1. **Update eas.json to specify the image**:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "resourceClass": "m-medium",
        "autoIncrement": true,
        "image": "latest"  // This ensures latest Xcode
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Rebuild the app**:
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

### Option 2: Check Your Build Details

Your current build:
- **Build Date**: 8/9/2025, 8:11:30 PM
- **App Version**: 1.0.0 (should be 1.1.0 now)
- **Build Number**: 8

The build is from yesterday and might be using an older image.

## 🎯 Immediate Actions

### Step 1: Cancel Current Submission
Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the current submission process.

### Step 2: Rebuild with Latest SDK
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /Users/jared.wolf/Projects/personal/tybeb_b/typeb-family-app

# Clear cache and rebuild
eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

### Step 3: Wait for New Build
- This will create Build #9
- Will use the latest Xcode/iOS SDK
- Takes ~20-30 minutes

### Step 4: Submit New Build
```bash
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

## 📊 Why This Happened

1. Your build (#8) was created yesterday before we updated to v1.1.0
2. EAS might have used an older build image
3. Apple's requirements changed recently (April 24, 2025)

## 🔧 Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Cancel current submission (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] Update eas.json to use "image": "latest"
- [ ] Rebuild with --clear-cache flag
- [ ] Wait for new build to complete
- [ ] Submit the new build to TestFlight

## 💡 Alternative: Use Existing Build #6

If Build #6 (from earlier today) was built with the correct SDK, you could try:
```bash
# List all builds
eas build:list --platform ios

# Submit a specific build
eas submit --platform ios --id=[BUILD_ID_OF_#6]
```

## 📝 Updated Build Command

Here's the complete command to fix this:

```bash
# All in one line
cd /Users/jared.wolf/Projects/personal/tybeb_b/typeb-family-app && eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

1. **Now**: Cancel and rebuild (~2 min)
2. **20-30 min**: New build completes
3. **5 min**: Submit to TestFlight
4. **30 min**: Processing in App Store Connect
5. **Today**: Available in TestFlight!

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**You need to rebuild with the latest iOS SDK.** The submission will work once you have a build created with Xcode 16/iOS 18 SDK.
