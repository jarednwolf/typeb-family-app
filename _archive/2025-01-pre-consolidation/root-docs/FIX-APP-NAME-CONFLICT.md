# ðŸ”§ Fix "TypeB" Name Already Taken Issue

## The Problem
You're getting an error that "TypeB" is already taken because you accidentally created a second app with that name. Even after deletion, Apple reserves the name for a period.

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Use a Variation (Quickest)
Since "TypeB" is temporarily unavailable, use a slight variation:

**Recommended alternatives:**
- **"TypeB - Family Tasks"** (adds context)
- **"TypeB Tasks"** (short and clear)
- **"TypeB App"** (simple addition)
- **"Type B"** (with a space)

**How to apply:**
1. Go to **App Information** â†’ **Localizable Information**
2. Enter one of the alternatives in the **Name** field
3. Click **Save**

### Solution 2: Check Your Deleted App Status
1. Go to **App Store Connect** â†’ **My Apps**
2. Look for a filter or dropdown that shows **"Removed Apps"** or **"All Apps"**
3. Find the deleted "TypeB" app
4. Check its status - it might be in:
   - **"Removed from Sale"** state (can be reactivated)
   - **"Developer Removed"** state (waiting period applies)

### Solution 3: Contact Apple Support
If you need the exact name "TypeB":

1. Go to [Contact Us](https://developer.apple.com/contact/#!/topic/select)
2. Select **"App Store Connect and Distribution"**
3. Select **"App Name"**
4. Explain:
   ```
   I accidentally created a duplicate app named "TypeB" and deleted it. 
   I need to use this name for my main app (ID: 6749812496). 
   Can you release the name or transfer it to my active app?
   ```

### Solution 4: Wait for Name Release
- Deleted app names are typically held for **90-180 days**
- After this period, the name becomes available again
- Not ideal if you need to launch immediately

## Recommended Approach for Today

Use **"TypeB - Family Tasks"** for now because:
1. It's immediately available
2. More descriptive for App Store search
3. You can change it later when "TypeB" becomes available
4. Users will still find you searching for "TypeB"

## App Icon Upload Instructions

### Icon File Location
Your app icon is ready at:
```

```

### Where to Upload
1. In App Store Connect, go to your app
2. Navigate to **"App Store"** â†’ **"iOS App"** â†’ **"1.1.0 Prepare for Submission"**
3. Scroll down to the **"App Icon"** section
4. Click **"Choose File"**
5. Select: `AppIcon-1024x1024.png` from the `app-store-icon` folder
6. The system will validate and accept the icon

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Choose app name variation (recommend: "TypeB - Family Tasks")
- [ ] Update name in App Information section
- [ ] Upload `AppIcon-1024x1024.png` to App Icon section

## Future Name Change

3. Users won't lose any data or reviews
4. The transition is seamless
