# App Icon Fix and Build #19

## Issue Identified
Build #18 was showing without an app icon in App Store Connect because the `Contents.json` file in the iOS asset catalog was only referencing the 1024x1024 marketing icon, missing all the required app icon sizes.

## Fix Applied
Updated `ios/TypeBFamily/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json` to include all icon sizes:
- 20x20 @2x and @3x (Notification icons)
- 29x29 @2x and @3x (Settings icons)
- 40x40 @2x and @3x (Spotlight icons)
- 60x60 @2x and @3x (App icons)
- 1024x1024 (App Store marketing icon)

All these icon files were already present in the directory but weren't being referenced properly.
