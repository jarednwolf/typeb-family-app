# TypeB Family App - Engagement Phase 2 Implementation

## Previous Implementation Summary
- Task completion animations with checkmark and starburst effects
- Random encouragement messages (no points/XP system)
- Haptic feedback for iOS devices
- Age-appropriate engagement for 11-14 year olds

## Phase 2 Implementation Requirements

### 1. Surface Streak Tracking on Dashboard
**Current State**: Streak calculation logic already exists in AnalyticsDashboard component
**Requirements**:
- Create a dedicated StreakDisplay component that shows current streak prominently
- Display streak in dashboard header area with visual emphasis
- Show "flame" text indicator when streak is active (e.g., "7 Day Streak [FIRE]")
- Include streak recovery message if streak was recently broken
- Animate streak number changes with spring effect

### 2. Parent Reactions System
**IMPORTANT**: No emoji characters - use text-based reactions only
**Requirements**:
- Create ParentReaction component for task cards
- Available reactions: "STAR", "FIRE", "CLAP", "HEART", "THUMBS UP"
- Display reactions as styled text bubbles below tasks
- Parents can tap to add/remove their reaction
- Show parent's name with reaction: "Mom: STAR"
- Maximum one reaction per parent per task
- Reactions persist in Firestore under task document
- Kids see all parent reactions on their tasks

### 3. Circular Progress Rings
**Requirements**:
- Create ProgressRing component using SVG
- Display daily/weekly task completion percentage
- Animate ring fill on mount and value changes
- Color coding: 
  - 0-25%: Red
  - 26-50%: Orange  
  - 51-75%: Yellow
  - 76-100%: Green
- Show percentage text in center
- Use in dashboard and task lists
- Support different sizes (small, medium, large)

### 4. Milestone Celebrations
**Requirements**:
- Trigger celebrations at: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% daily completion
- Create MilestoneCelebration component
- Celebration includes:
  - Full-screen modal overlay
  - Animated milestone badge (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond)
  - Encouraging message specific to milestone
  - Confetti-style particle effects (using React Native Animatable)
  - Duration: 3 seconds auto-dismiss
- Store milestone achievements in user profile
- Only show each milestone once per day
- Parent notifications when kids hit milestones

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
src/components/engagement/
├── StreakDisplay.tsx
├── ParentReaction.tsx
├── ProgressRing.tsx
├── MilestoneCelebration.tsx
└── index.ts

src/services/
├── reactions.ts (Parent reaction logic)
└── milestones.ts (Milestone tracking)
```

### Database Schema Updates
```typescript
// Task document update
interface Task {
  // ... existing fields
  parentReactions?: {
    [parentId: string]: {
      reaction: 'STAR' | 'FIRE' | 'CLAP' | 'HEART' | 'THUMBS_UP';
      timestamp: Timestamp;
      parentName: string;
    }
  }
}

// User profile update  
interface UserProfile {
  // ... existing fields
  milestones?: {
    daily: {
      [date: string]: {
        bronze: boolean;  // 25%
        silver: boolean;  // 50%
        gold: boolean;    // 75%
        diamond: boolean; // 100%
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Integration Points
1. Dashboard: Add StreakDisplay and ProgressRing components
2. TaskCard: Integrate ParentReaction component
3. Task completion flow: Check for milestone triggers
4. Navigation: Handle MilestoneCelebration overlay properly

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load celebration animations
- Debounce reaction updates
- Cache progress calculations
- Use React.memo for progress rings

### Accessibility
- Ensure all text-based reactions have proper ARIA labels
- Progress rings need descriptive text alternatives
- Celebrations should not auto-play animations if reduced motion is enabled

## Priority Order
1. Progress Rings (visual feedback foundation)
2. Streak Display (leverage existing logic)
3. Parent Reactions (engagement driver)
4. Milestone Celebrations (retention mechanism)

## Success Metrics
- Increased daily active usage
- Higher task completion rates
- More parent-child interactions
- Improved streak retention

## Notes
- NO EMOJI CHARACTERS - all reactions must be text-based
- Keep animations smooth but not overwhelming
- Ensure all features work offline-first
- Test on low-end devices for performance
