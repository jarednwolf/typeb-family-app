# Next Prompt Context for TypeB Family App Development

## Perfect Next Prompt

```
Please implement the RevenueCat integration and Priority Support system for the TypeB Family App to complete the remaining 20% of premium features. The implementation guide is in docs/PREMIUM-FEATURES-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md with all the code templates ready. Focus on:

1. Installing and configuring RevenueCat SDK
2. Creating the revenueCat.ts service file
3. Implementing the Priority Support system with ticket management
4. Adding the SupportScreen component
5. Integrating both features into the existing app navigation

The app is currently running with Firebase emulators and the premium infrastructure is already in place with 4 of 6 features complete.

### Implementation Requirements

#### RevenueCat Integration Needs
1. Install SDK: `npm install react-native-purchases@7.27.1`
2. Configure API keys (placeholder in guide)
3. Create service file at `typeb-family-app/src/services/revenueCat.ts`
4. Update PremiumScreen with purchase UI
5. Initialize in App.tsx on auth state change
6. Test purchase flow in sandbox

#### Priority Support System Needs
1. Create types at `typeb-family-app/src/types/support.ts`
2. Create service at `typeb-family-app/src/services/support.ts`
3. Create UI at `typeb-family-app/src/screens/support/SupportScreen.tsx`
4. Add to navigation in MainNavigator.tsx
5. Configure Firestore collections for tickets
6. Test ticket creation and FAQ voting

### Environment Configuration
- **Firebase Emulators**: Running on ports 9099 (Auth), 8080 (Firestore), 9199 (Storage)
- **Development**: Using Firebase emulator for testing
- **Production**: Firebase project configured (not yet deployed)

### Testing Checklist for New Features
- [ ] RevenueCat purchase flow in sandbox
- [ ] Subscription status updates
- [ ] Restore purchases functionality
- [ ] Support ticket creation (free vs premium)
- [ ] Priority badge for premium tickets
- [ ] FAQ voting system
- [ ] Response time messaging

### Known Issues and Considerations
1. iOS E2E tests blocked by architecture issues (M1/M2 compatibility)
2. Family/Task service tests blocked by Firebase Admin SDK limitations
3. Modal component tests skipped due to animation complexity
4. Need real RevenueCat API keys for production

### Success Metrics
- **Target**: 5-10% free to premium conversion
- **Support Response**: <2 hours for premium, <48 hours for free
- **App Store Rating**: Target 4.0+
- **Premium Features**: Must all work seamlessly

2. Implement Priority Support system (Week 1)
3. Test both features thoroughly (Week 2)
4. Prepare for TestFlight beta with IAP (Week 2)
