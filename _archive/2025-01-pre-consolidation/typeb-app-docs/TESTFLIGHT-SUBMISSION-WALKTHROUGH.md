# üì± TestFlight Submission - Complete Walkthrough

## üö® Current Status
You're seeing the App Store Connect API Key selection screen. This is perfect! You're already in the submission process.

## üìç Where You Are Now

Looking at your terminal, you're at the step where you need to select an App Store Connect API Key. You have two options:
1. **[Choose an existing key]** - Select this if you already have an API key configured
2. **[Add a new key]** - Select this if you need to create a new one

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Select API Key Option

**Choose: `[Choose an existing key]`** (the blue highlighted option)

Press Enter to select it.

### Step 2: Select Your Existing Key

If you have multiple keys, select the one you created for this project. It should be the one with:
- Key ID: `KS2265QQ7W` (or similar)
- The one you used for RevenueCat setup

### Step 3: Enter App-Specific Password

When prompted for password:
1. **DO NOT use your regular Apple ID password**
2. **Use an app-specific password instead**

#### How to Create App-Specific Password:
1. Go to: https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. In the "Sign-In and Security" section, select "App-Specific Passwords"
4. Click the "+" button to generate a new password
5. Name it: "EAS Submit" or "TypeB TestFlight"
6. Copy the generated password (format: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)
7. Use this password in the terminal

### Step 4: Submission Process

After entering the app-specific password, EAS will:
1. Connect to App Store Connect
2. Upload your IPA file
3. Submit to TestFlight
4. Show progress indicators
5. Confirm submission success

### Step 5: What Happens Next

After successful submission:
- **Processing Time**: 5-30 minutes
- **Email Notification**: You'll receive an email when processing is complete
- **TestFlight Status**: Build will appear in App Store Connect

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If "Choose an existing key" doesn't work:

Select **[Add a new key]** and follow these steps:

1. **You'll be redirected to App Store Connect**
2. **Create a new API key**:
   - Name: "EAS Submit Key"
   - Access: "App Manager"
   - Download the .p8 file
3. **Return to terminal**
4. **Enter the key details**:
   - Key ID (from the downloaded file name)
   - Issuer ID (from App Store Connect)
   - Path to .p8 file

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using an app-specific password, not your regular password
- Check that 2FA is enabled on your Apple ID

#### "No such file or directory: typeb-family-app"
- You're already in the correct directory!
- Just run: `eas submit --platform ios --latest`
- Don't add the `cd typeb-family-app` part

#### "Invalid API key"
- The key might have expired
- Create a new one in App Store Connect

## üìä Complete Command Reference

### From your current location (already in typeb-family-app):
```bash
# You're already here, so just run:
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

### If you need to start over from anywhere:
```bash
# Go to the project root first
cd /Users/jared.wolf/Projects/personal/tybeb_b/typeb-family-app

# Then submit
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

### Check submission status:
```bash
eas submit:list --platform ios
```
