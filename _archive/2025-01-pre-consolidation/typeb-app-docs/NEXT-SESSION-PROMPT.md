## PROMPT:

I need help completing the production launch of my TypeB Family App. Here's the current status and what needs to be done:

## Project Overview
- **App Name**: TypeB Family App
- **Version**: 1.1.0
- **Location**: `/Users/jared.wolf/Projects/personal/tybeb_b/typeb-family-app`
- **Description**: Family task management app with premium features (photo validation, custom categories, smart notifications, analytics, payments, support)
- **Tech Stack**: React Native, Expo, Firebase, RevenueCat, Sentry

## Current Status (85% Complete)

### ‚úÖ What's Done:
1. **All features implemented** - 6 premium features working
2. **Testing complete** - 253 component tests passing
3. **Firebase deployed** - Rules, indexes, all services live in production
4. **RevenueCat configured** - iOS API Key: `appl_KIZQUiQQubnWSzibevPYMVWWTjC`
5. **Sentry integrated** - Project ID: 4509816890851328
6. **App icons created** - Generated from TypeB logo
7. **Version updated** - Now at 1.1.0
8. **Git configured** - Tagged as v1.1.0

### üöß Current Blocker:
**iOS Build SDK Issue** - Apple requires iOS 18 SDK (Xcode 16+) as of April 24, 2025. Our last build (#6) was rejected from TestFlight because it used an older SDK. The `eas.json` has been updated to use `"image": "latest"` but we need to rebuild.

### ‚è≥ What's Left:

#### Immediate Priority (Today):
1. **Rebuild iOS app with iOS 18 SDK**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jared.wolf/Projects/personal/tybeb_b/typeb-family-app
   eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
   ```

2. **Submit to TestFlight**
   ```bash
   eas submit --platform ios --latest
   ```
   - Use API Key: 3QKNJ9VR94
   - Need app-specific password (not regular Apple ID password)

3. **Configure TestFlight**
   - Add test information
   - Create testing groups
   - Invite beta testers

#### Next Priority (This Weekend):
4. **Build Android version**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```

5. **Submit to Google Play**
   - Internal testing track first
   - Then production release

#### Lower Priority:
6. **Fix E2E tests** - 7 files need test IDs (non-blocking)
7. **Configure free trial** - Can only be done after TestFlight submission
8. **Create app store assets** - Screenshots, descriptions, keywords

## Key Information

## Specific Questions/Issues:

1. Should I rebuild the iOS app now or wait?
2. How do I create an app-specific password for TestFlight submission?
3. What's the best strategy for beta testing?
4. Should I start the Android build while iOS is processing?
5. How do I monitor the app post-launch?

## Expected Outcomes:

Please help me:
1. Successfully rebuild the iOS app with iOS 18 SDK
2. Submit to TestFlight without errors
3. Start the Android build process
4. Create a launch checklist for the app stores
5. Set up monitoring and analytics dashboards

## Additional Context:

- This is my first app launch
- I have Apple Developer and Google Play accounts

Please provide step-by-step guidance for completing the launch, starting with the iOS rebuild.
