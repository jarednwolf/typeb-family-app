## Week 2 Goals & Tasks

### 🎯 Primary Objectives
1. Enhance visual hierarchy with elevation and shadows
2. Add delightful microinteractions and animations
3. Improve perceived performance with smooth transitions
4. Create a cohesive design system with consistent spacing
5. Add celebratory moments for task completion

### 📋 Week 2 Task List (Days 6-10)

#### Day 6-7: Visual Polish
- [ ] Add elevation/shadows to cards using React Native shadow properties
- [ ] Implement consistent border radius system (4, 8, 12, 16px)
- [ ] Create visual feedback for all interactive elements (scale, opacity)
- [ ] Add subtle animations to state changes (task status, selections)
- [ ] Improve empty state illustrations with animations
- [ ] Update card designs with better visual hierarchy
- [ ] Add visual indicators for task priority/urgency
- [ ] Implement consistent spacing system (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32)

#### Day 8-9: Animation & Transitions
- [ ] Add page transition animations using React Navigation transitions
- [ ] Implement task completion celebration animation
- [ ] Create smooth loading transitions (fade/slide)
- [ ] Add gesture-based interactions (swipe to complete/delete)
- [ ] Implement parallax scrolling on dashboard
- [ ] Add micro-animations for buttons (press/release)
- [ ] Create animated progress bars
- [ ] Add bounce animations for achievement unlocks

#### Day 10: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Conduct usability testing with 5 users
- [ ] A/B test new interactions
- [ ] Measure performance impact of animations
- [ ] Document design system updates
- [ ] Create PR for Week 2 changes
- [ ] Update MASTER-TRACKER.md

### 🛠 Technical Requirements

#### Animation Libraries to Use
- React Native Reanimated 2 (already installed)
- React Native Gesture Handler (already installed)
- Lottie React Native (for complex animations)

#### Design System Updates Needed
```typescript
// Update theme/index.ts with:
- elevation levels (0, 2, 4, 8, 16)
- animation durations (fast: 200ms, normal: 300ms, slow: 500ms)
- easing curves (standard, decelerate, accelerate)
- border radius scale (xs: 4, sm: 8, md: 12, lg: 16, xl: 24)
```

#### Performance Considerations
- Use `useNativeDriver: true` for all animations
- Implement `InteractionManager` for heavy operations
- Add `shouldComponentUpdate` or `React.memo` where needed
- Monitor FPS during animations (target 60fps)

### 📊 Success Metrics
- Animation FPS: >55fps on mid-range devices
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5 on visual appeal
- Task completion celebration viewed: >80%
- Reduced cognitive load: 20% faster task scanning
- Engagement increase: 15% more interactions

### 🎨 Visual Design Guidelines

#### Elevation & Shadows
```javascript
// iOS
shadowColor: '#000',
shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
shadowOpacity: 0.1,
shadowRadius: 4,

// Android
elevation: 4,
```

#### Animation Patterns
- **Entry**: Fade + Scale (0.95 → 1.0)
- **Exit**: Fade + Scale (1.0 → 0.95)
- **Success**: Bounce + Haptic
- **Error**: Shake + Haptic
- **Loading**: Pulse or Shimmer

#### Color Usage for States
- **Interactive**: Slight darken on press (-10% brightness)
- **Disabled**: 50% opacity
- **Success**: Green overlay fade
- **Error**: Red shake with fade

### 📝 Implementation Order

1. **Start with TaskCard.tsx**
   - Add elevation and shadows
   - Implement press animations
   - Add swipe gestures
   - Create completion celebration

2. **Update Button.tsx**
   - Add press/release animations
   - Implement ripple effect
   - Add loading state animations

3. **Enhance Navigation**
   - Add screen transitions
   - Implement tab bar animations
   - Add header animations

4. **Polish Dashboard**
   - Add parallax scrolling
   - Animate statistics updates
   - Create smooth card entries

5. **Celebration Moments**
   - Task completion animation
   - Streak milestone celebration
   - Achievement unlock animation

### 🚫 Constraints & Considerations

- **Accessibility**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- **Performance**: Disable animations on low-end devices
- **Battery**: Limit continuous animations
- **Consistency**: Follow Material Design or iOS HIG where applicable

### 📚 Resources

#### Documentation
- [React Native Reanimated 2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/)
- [Material Design Motion](https://material.io/design/motion)
- [iOS Human Interface Guidelines - Animation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/animation/)

#### Example Code Patterns
```javascript
// Animated Press
const animatedScale = useSharedValue(1);
const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [{ scale: animatedScale.value }]
}));

const handlePressIn = () => {
  animatedScale.value = withSpring(0.95);
};

const handlePressOut = () => {
  animatedScale.value = withSpring(1);
};
```

### 🎯 Deliverables

By end of Week 2, you should have:
1. ✅ Enhanced visual hierarchy across all screens
2. ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
3. ✅ Gesture-based interactions
4. ✅ Celebration animations for achievements
5. ✅ Updated design system documentation
6. ✅ Performance metrics report
7. ✅ User testing feedback summary
8. ✅ PR ready for review

## Starting Prompt for Week 2

```
I'm working on Week 2 of the TypeB Family App UI/UX improvements. Week 1 successfully implemented accessibility, error handling, and core UX features. 

For Week 2, I need to focus on visual hierarchy and microinteractions:
- Add elevation/shadows to cards
- Implement smooth animations and transitions
- Create gesture-based interactions
- Add celebration moments
- Ensure all animations respect accessibility settings

Please help me implement these improvements systematically, starting with Day 6-7 visual polish tasks. I have React Native Reanimated 2 and Gesture Handler already installed.

The codebase includes:
- AccessibilityContext for checking reduced motion preferences
- Haptic feedback system already in place
- Theme system that needs elevation and animation constants
- Components that need animation: TaskCard, Button, Navigation

Let's begin with adding elevation and animations to the TaskCard component.
```
