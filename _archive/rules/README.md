# Rules Archive

This directory stores non-canonical Firestore/Storage rules versions for reference.

- Canonical Firestore rules: `firestore.rules`
- Canonical Storage rules: `storage.rules`
- Indexes: `firestore.indexes.json`

Move experimental or environment-specific variants here (e.g., `firestore.rules.dev`, `firestore.rules.improved`) and reference the canonical files in `firebase.json` for deploys.
