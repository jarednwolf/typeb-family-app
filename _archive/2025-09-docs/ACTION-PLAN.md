# TypeB Production Launch Action Plan

**Generated**: January 2025  
**Timeline**: 7-14 days to production  
**Current Readiness**: 52%

## 📋 Executive Summary

After comprehensive assessment of the TypeB codebase and documentation:

### ✅ What You Have
- **Feature-complete** application with core functionality working
- **iOS TestFlight** build (#24) deployed for beta testing
- **Web app** live at https://typebapp.com
- **Firebase backend** configured and operational
- **Solid codebase** with 70% test coverage

### 🔴 What You're Missing (Critical)
1. **No CI/CD pipeline** - All deployments are manual
2. **No COPPA compliance** - Legal requirement for US launch
3. **Missing external services** - RevenueCat and Sentry not configured
4. **No staging environment usage** - Testing in production
5. **No Google SSO** - Requested feature not implemented

## 🎯 Immediate Actions Required (Day 1)

### 1. Set Up Critical Accounts
```bash
# TODAY - Get these accounts and keys:
□ RevenueCat Account → Get API keys
□ Sentry Account → Get DSN
□ Apple Developer Account → $99/year
□ Google Play Developer → $25 one-time
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
```bash
# Add to Settings → Secrets → Actions:
VERCEL_TOKEN
VERCEL_ORG_ID
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
FIREBASE_TOKEN
EXPO_TOKEN
SENTRY_DSN
REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS
REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID
```

### 3. Create Environment Files
```bash
# Copy and configure:
cp env.example .env.staging
cp env.example .env.production
# Edit with production values
```

pnpm test            # Run tests
pnpm build           # Build all packages

# Firebase
firebase emulators:start     # Local development
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules  # Deploy rules
firebase use typeb-family-app-staging   # Switch project

# Deployment
vercel --prod        # Deploy web to production
eas build --platform ios --profile production  # Build iOS
eas submit --platform ios --latest  # Submit to TestFlight

# Git
git checkout -b feature/coppa-compliance
git commit -m "feat: add COPPA compliance"
git push origin feature/coppa-compliance
```

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation Strategies

### If Behind Schedule
1. **Soft launch** with 100 beta users only
2. **Defer Android** - focus on iOS/Web
3. **Manual deployments** - skip CI/CD initially
4. **Email-only auth** - skip Google SSO

### If Issues Arise
- **Payment fails**: Test in sandbox extensively
- **COPPA complex**: Use simple email verification
- **Load test fails**: Limit initial users
- **App rejected**: Have backup build ready

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Launch Day
- [ ] Zero P0 bugs
- [ ] <1% error rate
- [ ] Payment success >95%
- [ ] All critical paths working

### Week 1
- [ ] 100+ signups
- [ ] 4.0+ app rating
- [ ] <5 support tickets/day
- [ ] 20% trial conversion

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Take 1-2 extra days if possible (9 days total)
2. Focus only on P0 blockers
3. Use soft launch strategy
4. Iterate based on user feedback
