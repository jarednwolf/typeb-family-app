# 4. Get API keys from Project Settings
# 5. Update typeb-family-app/.env.production:
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS=appl_[YOUR_KEY]

## 🚨 Contingency Plans

### If RevenueCat/Sentry Delays
- Launch with free tier only
- Add premium features in v1.1
- Use Firebase Crashlytics instead of Sentry

### If Test Infrastructure Fails
- Focus on manual testing
- Create detailed test scripts
- Use TestFlight/Play Console for testing

### If App Store Rejects
- Common rejection reasons:
  - Missing privacy policy (we have it)
  - Incomplete features (test thoroughly)
  - Crashes (beta test extensively)
- Have fixes ready within 24 hours
- Resubmit immediately

### If Critical Bug Found
- Hotfix process:
  1. Fix in development
  2. Test thoroughly
  3. Emergency build
  4. Expedited review request
