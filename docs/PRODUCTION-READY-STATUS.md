# Production Ready Status - TypeB Family App

## ✅ Current Status: WORKING & PRODUCTION READY

   - Solution: Changed from percentage strings to numeric pixel values
   - File: `src/components/common/FilterTabs.tsx`

2. **Development Build vs Expo Go** - RESOLVED ✅
   - Using development build (`npx expo run:ios`)
   - Not using Expo Go (which has SDK version mismatch)
   - Development client properly installed and running

### Current Running Services
