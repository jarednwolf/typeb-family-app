## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents in the TypeB Family App. All team members must be familiar with these procedures and act swiftly when an incident is detected.

### Objectives
- Minimize damage and service disruption
- Protect user data and privacy
- Maintain evidence for investigation
- Restore normal operations quickly
- Learn from incidents to prevent recurrence

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### P0 - Critical (Response Time: Immediate)
- Data breach affecting multiple users
- Complete service outage
- Active exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Ransomware or malware infection
- Authentication system compromise

#### P1 - High (Response Time: < 1 hour)
- Single user data breach
- Partial service outage
- Suspected intrusion attempts
- Critical vulnerability discovered
- Rate limiting bypass

#### P2 - Medium (Response Time: < 4 hours)
- Failed intrusion attempts
- Unusual system behavior
- Non-critical vulnerability
- Performance degradation
- Suspicious user activity

#### P3 - Low (Response Time: < 24 hours)
- Policy violations
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Failed authentication spikes
- Non-sensitive information disclosure

## Response Team

### Core Team Roles

#### Incident Commander (IC)
- Overall incident coordination
- Decision making authority
- External communication
- Resource allocation

#### Security Lead
- Technical investigation
- Vulnerability assessment
- Mitigation strategy
- Evidence collection

#### Engineering Lead

### Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Primary Contact | Backup Contact | Escalation Time |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| P0 | CTO | CEO | Immediate |
| P1 | Security Lead | CTO | 15 minutes |
| P2 | On-call Engineer | Security Lead | 30 minutes |
| P3 | On-call Engineer | Team Lead | 2 hours |

## Detection & Alerting

### Automated Detection
```javascript
// Security monitoring integration
import { securityMonitoring, SecurityEventType, SecuritySeverity } from './services/securityMonitoring';

// Critical event detection
securityMonitoring.on('criticalEvent', async (event) => {
  if (event.severity === SecuritySeverity.CRITICAL) {
    await triggerIncidentResponse(event);
  }
});
```

### Alert Channels
1. **PagerDuty** - Critical alerts
2. **Slack #security-alerts** - All security events
3. **Email** - Daily summaries
4. **SMS** - P0/P1 incidents only

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed login attempts > 50/hour
- Rate limit violations > 100/hour
- 500 errors > 10/minute
- Database query time > 5 seconds
- Unauthorized access attempts > 10/hour

## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection & Analysis (0-30 minutes)

1. **Acknowledge Alert**
   ```
   - Respond in Slack with "@here investigating [incident-id]"
   - Create incident channel #incident-[date]-[id]
   - Start incident timer
   ```

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Verify the incident is real (not false positive)
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Classify severity level
   - Identify affected systems/users

3. **Activate Response Team**
   - Page required team members
   - Assign roles
   - Open conference bridge if P0/P1

### Phase 2: Containment (30-60 minutes)

#### Short-term Containment
```bash
# Example: Block suspicious IP
firebase functions:config:set security.blocked_ips="1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8"

# Example: Disable compromised user
firebase auth:import users.json --hash-algo=SHA256 --rounds=8
```

#### Evidence Collection
```bash
# Export security logs
firebase firestore:export gs://typeb-incident-evidence/incident-[id]

# Capture system state
kubectl logs -n production > logs-[timestamp].txt
kubectl describe pods -n production > pods-[timestamp].txt
```

#### Long-term Containment
- Implement firewall rules
- Rotate compromised credentials
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Update security rules

### Phase 3: Eradication (1-4 hours)

1. **Remove Threat**
   - Delete malicious code
   - Remove unauthorized access
   - Clean infected systems
   - Update security patches

2. **Verify Removal**
   ```javascript
   // Run security scan
   await securityMonitoring.runFullScan({
     checkpoints: [
       'authentication',
       'authorization', 
       'dataIntegrity',
       'malwareDetection'
     ]
   });
   ```

### Phase 4: Recovery (2-8 hours)

1. **Restore Services**
   ```bash
   # Gradual rollout
   gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=production=10,staging=90
   # Monitor for 30 minutes
   gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=production=50,staging=50
   # Full restoration
   gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=production=100
   ```

2. **Verify Functionality**
   - Run automated tests
   - Check monitoring dashboards
   - Verify user access
   - Test critical flows

3. **Monitor for Recurrence**
   - Enhanced logging for 48 hours
   - Additional alerting rules
   - Manual checks every 2 hours

### Phase 5: Post-Incident (24-48 hours)

1. **Document Timeline**
2. **Conduct Review Meeting**
3. **Update Procedures**
4. **Implement Improvements**
