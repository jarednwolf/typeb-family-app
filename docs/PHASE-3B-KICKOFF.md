## 🚀 Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Start with Dashboard screen (most complex)
2. Create FilterTabs component
3. Wire up Redux data to Dashboard
4. Implement pull-to-refresh
5. Add loading and empty states

### Development Order
```
Dashboard → Tasks → Family → Settings → Onboarding
```

### Key Decisions to Make
1. Tab vs drawer navigation?
2. Modal vs full screen for task detail?
3. How to handle offline state?
4. Premium feature messaging?

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Dashboard complexity might take longer
- Real-time sync performance
- Navigation state management

### Medium Risk
- Form validation edge cases
- Photo upload implementation
- Premium gates implementation

### Low Risk
- Settings screen (straightforward)
- Onboarding (can be simple initially)
- Component styling (foundation exists)

## 🎯 Phase 3B Completion Target

**Target Date**: End of Session 10  
**Production Readiness Goal**: 8.0/10  
**Key Milestone**: Fully functional UI with all core screens  

### What Success Looks Like
- User can navigate all screens
- Tasks can be created, edited, deleted
- Family management works
- Settings are functional
- App feels polished and responsive

## 📝 Notes

### From Phase 3A Review
- Components work well but need accessibility
- Animations need native driver fixes
- Consider creating base component for shared props
- Add haptic feedback for better UX

### Architecture Considerations
- Keep screens thin, logic in services
- Use custom hooks for complex state
- Memoize expensive computations
- Lazy load heavy components

### Remember
- **Zero tech debt policy** - Fix issues as we go
- **Test as we build** - Don't defer testing
- **Document decisions** - Update MASTER-TRACKER.md
- **Regular commits** - Every 2 hours or feature
