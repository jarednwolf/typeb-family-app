# TypeB - Critical Gotchas & Risk Analysis

## üö® HIGH-RISK GOTCHAS

### 1. Apple App Store Timeline Reality Check
**The Problem**: Quick App Store launch is unrealistic
- **TestFlight Review**: 24-48 hours
- **App Store Review**: 24-72 hours (can be up to 7 days)
- **Rejection Risk**: 30% of apps get rejected first time
- **Fix & Resubmit**: Another 24-72 hours

**Mitigation**:
- Submit to TestFlight by Phase 5 (not Phase 7)
- Have backup plan for common rejections
- Prepare all App Store assets in advance

### 2. Expo Limitations We Haven't Discussed
**The Problem**: Expo managed workflow has restrictions
- **No Background Geolocation**: Can't do location-based reminders
- **Limited Background Tasks**: Only ~30 seconds of background time
- **Custom Native Modules**: Would require ejecting from Expo
- **Push Notification Limits**: Can't customize notification sounds

**Mitigation**:
- Accept these limitations for MVP
- Plan for Expo bare workflow if needed later
- Use Expo notifications as-is

### 3. Firebase Costs Can Explode
**The Problem**: Free tier limits we'll hit quickly
- **Firestore**: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
- **Storage**: 5GB total, 1GB/day transfer
- **Cloud Functions**: 125K invocations/month
- **With 100 users**: Could hit limits in days

**Cost Reality**:
- 1000 active users = ~$100-200/month
- 10,000 users = ~$1000-2000/month
- Photo storage adds $0.026/GB/month

**Mitigation**:
- Implement read caching aggressively
- Compress photos before upload
- Batch Firestore operations
- Monitor usage daily

### 4. RevenueCat + Apple Subscriptions Complexity
**The Problem**: Can't just "turn on" subscriptions
- **Apple Developer**: Need paid account ($99/year)
- **Tax Forms**: Must complete before selling
- **Bank Account**: Must be verified
- **App Store Products**: Must be created and approved
- **RevenueCat**: Needs products synced from App Store

**Timeline Impact**: 3-5 days for Apple approvals

**Mitigation**:
- Start Apple setup NOW
- Create products in App Store Connect immediately
- Test with sandbox accounts only initially

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM-RISK GOTCHAS

### 5. Family Data Isolation Complexity
**The Problem**: Firestore security rules get complex fast
```javascript
// This looks simple but isn't
match /tasks/{taskId} {
  allow read: if resource.data.familyId == getUserFamily();
  allow write: if isManager() || resource.data.assignedTo == userId;
}
```

**Issues**:
- Manager leaves family - who becomes manager?
- Deleted family member - what happens to tasks?
- Invite codes could collide or be guessed
- Cross-family data leaks possible

**Mitigation**:
- Write comprehensive security rule tests
- Use UUIDs for invite codes, not 6 characters
- Implement manager succession plan
- Soft-delete users, don't hard delete

### 6. Notification Reliability on iOS
**The Problem**: iOS aggressively manages notifications
- **Delivery Not Guaranteed**: Can be delayed or dropped
- **Quiet Hours**: OS might override our settings
- **Battery Optimization**: Kills background processes
- **Daily Limits**: Too many = throttled

**Reality**: 85-90% delivery rate is good

**Mitigation**:
- Set user expectations in onboarding
- Implement notification history
- Add manual "check for tasks" button
- Consider SMS backup for critical reminders ($)

### 7. Offline Sync Will Have Edge Cases
**The Problem**: Conflict resolution is hard
- **Same task edited offline by 2 users**: Who wins?
- **Family member removed while offline**: They can still edit
- **Subscription expired while offline**: Premium features still work
- **Clock drift**: Device time wrong = wrong reminders

**Mitigation**:
- Last-write-wins strategy (simple but imperfect)
- Sync immediately on reconnection
- Server timestamp everything
- Show sync status clearly

### 8. Testing Limitations
**The Problem**: Can't fully test everything locally
- **Push Notifications**: Don't work in simulator
- **In-App Purchases**: Need TestFlight
- **Camera**: Simulator has limited support
- **Background Tasks**: Behave differently in dev
- **Family Scenarios**: Need multiple devices

**Mitigation**:
- Physical device testing from Phase 3
- Multiple TestFlight accounts
- Document what can't be tested locally

## üü° LOWER-RISK BUT IMPORTANT

### 9. Missing Legal/Compliance Requirements
**Not Built Yet**:
- Privacy Policy (REQUIRED for App Store)
- Terms of Service (REQUIRED)
- COPPA compliance for users under 13
- GDPR for EU users (future)
- California Privacy Rights Act

**Mitigation**:
- Use template privacy policy initially
- Add age gate in onboarding
- Store minimal data about minors

### 10. No Customer Support Infrastructure
**Not Planned**:
- No support email system
- No in-app feedback beyond analytics
- No admin dashboard
- No way to help locked-out users
- No refund process

**Mitigation**:
- Set up support@typeb.app forward to your email
- Build simple admin Firebase functions
- Document common issues

### 11. Data Migration Not Considered
**Future Problem**: 
- Schema changes after launch = migration needed
- No versioning strategy
- No rollback plan
- User data could be lost

**Mitigation**:
- Version the data schema from day 1
- Plan migration strategy before launch
- Test with production data copies

### 12. Performance Not Tested at Scale
**Unknown**:
- 100 tasks? 1000 tasks? When does it slow?
- Large families (10+ members)?
- Hundreds of photos?
- Poor network conditions?

**Mitigation**:
- Load test with realistic data
- Implement pagination everywhere
- Lazy load images
- Set limits (max 100 tasks visible)

## üíî HARD TRUTHS

### What Will Definitely Happen
1. **App Store will reject something** (prepare for 2-3 rounds)
2. **Notifications will fail for some users** (iOS restrictions)
3. **Firebase costs will exceed free tier quickly** (prepare to pay)
4. **Some edge case will corrupt user data** (need recovery plan)
5. **Users will find ways to break the family system** (need moderation)

### What We're Intentionally Accepting
1. **No Android for MVP** (losing 50% of market)
2. **No web app** (some users won't download apps)
3. **English only** (limiting global reach)
4. **US-only payments initially** (RevenueCat limitation)
5. **No accessibility features** (screen readers broken)

## üéØ CRITICAL PATH ADJUSTMENTS

### Must Do BEFORE Coding
1. **Create Apple Developer account** ($99)
2. **Register typeb.app domain** ($12/year)
3. **Set up support@typeb.app email**
4. **Write basic privacy policy**
5. **Create Firebase project**

### Adjusted Timeline Reality
- **Phases 1-5**: 5-6 days of solid coding
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 days testing and fixes
- **TestFlight**: 1-2 days for approval
- **Beta Testing**: 3-5 days minimum
- **App Store**: 2-7 days for approval

**Realistic Total**: 14-20 days to App Store

### The Hardest Technical Challenges
1. **Notification reliability** - Will frustrate users
2. **Offline sync conflicts** - Will cause data issues
3. **Family permission edge cases** - Will have security holes
4. **Subscription state sync** - Will have payment issues
5. **Photo upload at scale** - Will hit limits fast

## ‚úÖ PROCEED ANYWAY BECAUSE

Despite these gotchas, we should proceed because:
1. **Core concept is solid** - Families need this
2. **Technical stack is proven** - Firebase + React Native works
3. **MVP can be simpler** - Cut features, not quality
4. **Learning opportunity** - Each gotcha teaches us
5. **Iterative improvement** - Ship, learn, improve

## üöÄ ADJUSTED EXPECTATIONS

### Phase 1-2 Reality (Days 1-5)
- Functional app with core features
- TestFlight with 10-20 beta users
- Known issues documented
- Not yet in App Store

### Week 2 Reality  
- Beta feedback incorporated
- Major bugs fixed
- App Store submission
- Customer support ready

### Week 3 Reality
- App Store approved (hopefully)
- First real users
- Monitor and fix issues
- Plan version 2

**The biggest risk isn't technical - it's timeline expectations. Building a quality MVP in 2-3 weeks is realistic. Rushing leads to technical debt and poor user experience.**
