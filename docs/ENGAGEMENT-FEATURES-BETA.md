  currentStreak?: number;
  longestStreak?: number;
  lastCompletionDate?: Timestamp;
  soundsEnabled?: boolean;
}
```

### Redux State Updates
```typescript
interface TasksState {
  // ... existing state
  celebratingTaskId: string | null; // Track which task is celebrating
}

interface UserState {
  // ... existing state
  streakData: {
    current: number;
    longest: number;
    lastDate: string | null;
  };
}
```
