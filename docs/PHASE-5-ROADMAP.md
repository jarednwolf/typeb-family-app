# TypeB Family App - Phase 5 Roadmap: Path to App Store

**Created**: January 8, 2025  
**Estimated Timeline**: 4-5 weeks to App Store submission  
**Current State**: v1 complete with working app, needs polish and testing

## Executive Summary

After successful UAT, we have a working v1 app that needs:
1. Robust testing infrastructure to ensure reliability
2. UI polish and branding consistency
3. App store preparation and compliance
4. Feature expansion (post-launch)

## Priority 1: Robust Testing Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

### Why This Is First

- [ ] Write setup/teardown scripts for test data
- [ ] Document emulator setup process
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline integration

#### Day 3-4: Integration Test Migration
- [ ] Convert auth service tests to use emulators
- [ ] Convert family service tests to use emulators
- [ ] Convert task service tests to use emulators
- [ ] Add real permission testing
- [ ] Validate security rules with tests

#### Day 5-7: UI Component Testing

## Conclusion

This roadmap prioritizes stability and quality over new features. By focusing on testing first, then polish, then launch, we ensure a successful app store debut. Feature expansion comes after we have happy users and positive reviews.

The 4-5 week timeline is aggressive but achievable with focused effort. The key is to resist feature creep and maintain laser focus on each priority in sequence.
