# Type B Family App - Technical Architecture

## Project Overview
A productivity app helping Type B/C personality teens (middle school through college) develop structured habits through intelligent reminders, task management, and family accountability.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
  - Rapid development for iOS primary target
  - Easy expansion to Android and Web
  - Expo SDK for native features (notifications, camera, etc.)
  
- **Backend**: Firebase
  - Firestore for real-time data sync
  - Firebase Auth for user management
  - Cloud Storage for photo proof uploads
  - Cloud Functions for server-side logic
  - Cloud Messaging for push notifications
  
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
  - Predictable state updates
  - Offline-first capability
  - Optimistic updates for better UX
  
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library + Detox
  - Unit tests for business logic
  - Integration tests for Firebase operations
  - E2E tests for critical user flows

### Design System
- **Philosophy**: Clean & Minimal (Apple-inspired)
  - Extensive white space
  - Typography-focused
  - Subtle animations
  - Professional yet engaging
  
- **Component Library**: Custom components built on React Native Elements
  - Consistent design tokens
  - Reusable components
  - Accessibility built-in

## Data Architecture

### User Model
```
User {
  id: string
  email: string
  displayName: string
  role: 'manager' | 'member'
  familyId: string
  avatarUrl?: string
  createdAt: timestamp
  subscription: {
    status: 'free' | 'premium' | 'trial'
    expiresAt?: timestamp
  }
}
```

### Family Model
```
Family {
  id: string
  name: string
  managerId: string
  memberIds: string[]
  createdAt: timestamp
  settings: {
    timezone: string
    quietHours: { start: string, end: string }
  }
}
```

### Task Model
```
Task {
  id: string
  familyId: string
  title: string
  description?: string
  category: string
  assignedTo: string
  createdBy: string
  dueDate: timestamp
  recurrence?: {
    type: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'custom'
    pattern: object
  }
  reminder: {
    type: 'smart' | 'basic'
    settings: {
      initialReminder: number // minutes before
      escalationLevels?: number[]
      notifyManager?: boolean
    }
  }
  validation?: {
    required: boolean
    type: 'photo' | 'text' | 'manager_approval'
    proof?: {
      url?: string
      text?: string
      submittedAt?: timestamp
    }
  }
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'validated'
  completedAt?: timestamp
  validatedAt?: timestamp
  validatedBy?: string
}
```

### Routine Model
```
Routine {
  id: string
  familyId: string
  name: string
  category: string
  tasks: TaskTemplate[]
  assignedTo: string[]
  schedule: RecurrencePattern
  active: boolean
}
```

## MVP Feature Scope

### Free Tier (MVP)
- Single user account (family of 1)
- Task creation and management
- Basic reminders
- Task completion
- Dashboard view
- Category organization
- Recurring tasks

### Premium Tier ($4.99/month)
- Multiple family members (unlimited)
- Task validation with photo/text proof
- Manager oversight dashboard
- Smart reminder escalation
- Family member invitation system
- Priority support

### Future Premium Features (Post-MVP)
- Calendar integrations
- Gamification (points, streaks, badges)
- Advanced analytics
- Custom routine templates library
- API access

## Notification Architecture

### Smart Reminder System
1. **Initial Reminder**: Gentle notification at scheduled time
2. **Follow-up**: If not acknowledged within 15 minutes
3. **Escalation**: Increasing urgency at 30, 45 minutes
4. **Manager Alert**: Optional notification to parent if deadline missed

### Implementation
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
- Local notifications for immediate reminders
- Cloud Functions for scheduling and escalation logic
- Respect quiet hours and timezone settings

## Authentication & Security

### User Flow
1. Email/password registration
2. Email verification required
3. Family creation or join via invite code
4. Role assignment (manager vs member)

### Security Rules
- Users can only access their family's data
- Managers can create/modify all family tasks
- Members can only modify their assigned tasks
- Photo uploads restricted to task assignees
- Validation restricted to managers (premium)

## Testing Strategy

### Test-First Development
1. **Architecture Tests**: API contracts, data models
2. **Unit Tests**: Business logic, utilities
3. **Integration Tests**: Firebase operations, auth flows
4. **E2E Tests**: Critical paths (create task, complete task, validate)

### Critical Test Coverage
- Notification scheduling and delivery
- Data sync across devices
- Offline functionality
- Subscription management
- Task recurrence patterns

## Development Standards

### Code Organization
```
/src
  /components     # Reusable UI components
  /screens       # Screen components
  /navigation    # Navigation configuration
  /services      # Firebase, API services
  /store         # Redux store and slices
  /utils         # Helper functions
  /hooks         # Custom React hooks
  /constants     # App constants
  /types         # TypeScript definitions
```

### Coding Standards
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint + Prettier for code consistency
- Conventional commits for version control
- Component documentation with props
- Error boundaries for crash protection
- Performance monitoring with Sentry

### Git Workflow
- Main branch for production
- Develop branch for integration
- Feature branches for new features
- Hourly commits during development week
- Tag releases for App Store submissions

## Performance Targets
- App launch: < 2 seconds
- Screen transitions: < 300ms
- Offline to online sync: < 5 seconds

## Monitoring & Analytics
- Firebase Analytics for user behavior
- Crashlytics for crash reporting
- Performance monitoring for app speed
- Custom events for feature usage
- Subscription conversion tracking

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Notification Reliability**: Fallback to local notifications
2. **Data Loss**: Offline-first with automatic sync
3. **Scaling**: Firebase auto-scaling, pagination for large families
4. **Payment Issues**: Multiple payment providers (IAP + Stripe)
5. **App Rejection**: Strict adherence to App Store guidelines

## Success Metrics (MVP - 2-3 Weeks)
- 30 beta users acquired
- < 2% crash rate
- 90% notification delivery rate
- 5% free to premium conversion (1-2 users)
- 3.5+ TestFlight rating
