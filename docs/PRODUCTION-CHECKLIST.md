|------|--------|------------|------------|
| COPPA Non-compliance | 🔴 Critical | Medium | Use template, legal review |
| Payment Failures | 🔴 Critical | Low | Test extensively |
| No CI/CD | 🟡 High | Certain | Manual deploy if needed |
| Load Test Failure | 🟡 High | Low | Scale Firebase early |
| App Store Rejection | 🟡 High | Low | Pre-review checklist |

## 📝 Notes

### What's Working
- Core features complete and tested
- Firebase backend configured
- Web app deployed and running
- iOS app in TestFlight

### What's Missing
- Automated deployments (deploy/EAS steps in CI)
- Web error monitoring (Sentry on Next.js)
- Payment processing configuration (RevenueCat products/keys)
- COPPA policy content + end-to-end verification
- Staging environment usage

### Recommendations
1. **Extend timeline by 1 week** for proper setup
2. **Or do soft launch** with 100 beta users
3. **Focus on P0 items only** for 7-day timeline
4. **Defer Android** to post-launch
5. **Manual processes OK** initially
