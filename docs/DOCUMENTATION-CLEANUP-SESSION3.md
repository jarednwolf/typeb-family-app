# Documentation Cleanup - Session 3

## Changes Made

### 1. MASTER-TRACKER.md
- ✅ Updated with Session 3 notes
- ✅ Added go/no-go decision (GREEN LIGHT)
- ✅ Documented accepted risks
- ✅ Ready for Phase 1 development

### 2. development-standards.md
- ✅ Added CRITICAL RULE #3: AI Assistant Guidelines
- ✅ Reinforced single source of truth principle

### 3. Duplicate Document Created
- ❌ docs/minimal-validation-plan.md - TO BE DELETED
- This duplicates content from CRITICAL-GAPS-DISCOVERED.md
- Violates single source of truth principle

## Consistency Check

### Color Scheme
- All docs reference black (#0A0A0A) as primary
- Consistent across design-system.md and other docs
- Decision to A/B test later is documented

### Technical Stack
- Consistent across all documents
- React Native + Expo + Firebase confirmed
- No conflicting technology choices found

### Timeline & Expectations
- 2-3 weeks to App Store (realistic)
- 30 beta users target
- 5% conversion rate
- All consistently documented

### Validation Status
- CRITICAL-GAPS-DISCOVERED.md outlines Week 0 validation
- Decision made to skip validation and accept risks
- This is now documented in MASTER-TRACKER.md

## Documents Requiring No Updates
All other documents remain current and consistent:
- architecture.md
- implementation-plan.md
- testing-strategy.md
- project-structure.md
- zero-tech-debt-policy.md
- All other planning docs

## Action Items for Next Session
1. Delete docs/minimal-validation-plan.md (Code mode required)
2. Start Phase 1 following implementation-plan.md
3. Continue updating MASTER-TRACKER.md as work progresses

## Compliance with Standards
- ✅ MASTER-TRACKER.md remains single source of truth
- ✅ Documentation consistency maintained
- ✅ AI guidelines now documented
- ✅ Ready for development phase
