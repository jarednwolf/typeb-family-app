# TypeB - Zero Tech Debt Policy & Standards Enforcement

## ZERO TECH DEBT POLICY

### Core Principle
**We DO NOT accumulate technical debt. Ever.**

### Implementation Rules

1. **Every Phase = Production Ready**
   - Code is complete, tested, and deployable
   - No "we'll fix it later" mentality
   - No commented-out code
   - No console.logs in production code
   - No "temporary" solutions

2. **Dependency Exception Protocol**
   ```
   IF a feature depends on future work:
   1. Mark clearly with DEPENDENCY comment
   2. Add to MASTER-TRACKER.md under "Pending Dependencies"
   3. Create integration test that will fail until complete
   4. Add checkpoint at dependency phase completion
   5. MUST resolve before that phase ends
   ```

3. **Phase Completion Checklist**
   - [ ] All code production-ready
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] No TODO comments except DEPENDENCY
   - [ ] No console.logs
   - [ ] No commented code
   - [ ] Documentation complete
   - [ ] Code reviewed against standards

## STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST

### At Start of Each Session
```markdown
1. [ ] Open development-standards.md
2. [ ] Open MASTER-TRACKER.md
3. [ ] Review current phase requirements
4. [ ] Check pending dependencies
```

### Before Writing Any Code
```markdown
1. [ ] Does this follow our architecture pattern?
2. [ ] Is this the simplest solution?
3. [ ] Will this scale to 100K users?
4. [ ] Does this match our design system?
5. [ ] Have I checked the standards doc?
```

### Before Each Commit
```markdown
1. [ ] No tech debt introduced
2. [ ] Tests written and passing
3. [ ] Documentation updated
4. [ ] Standards followed
5. [ ] MASTER-TRACKER.md updated
```

### Standards Self-Audit Questions
- Am I using Heroicons (not other icons)?
- Am I using our color palette (#FAF8F5, etc)?
- Are error messages friendly but concise?
- Is validation instant on forms?
- Are we tracking all analytics events?
- Is offline support maintained?
- Does this follow feature-based architecture?

## COMPLETE TECH STACK AUDIT

### Core Stack (Confirmed)
✅ **Frontend Framework**: React Native + Expo
✅ **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
✅ **Navigation**: React Navigation v6
✅ **Forms**: React Hook Form
✅ **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Functions)
✅ **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
✅ **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics
✅ **Crash Reporting**: Firebase Crashlytics
✅ **Payments**: RevenueCat
✅ **Icons**: Heroicons

### Additional Requirements Identified

#### Phase 1-2 (Must Have)
- **Async Storage**: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- **Secure Storage**: expo-secure-store (for tokens)
- **Device Info**: expo-device
- **Constants**: expo-constants
- **Permissions**: expo-notifications, expo-camera
- **Date Handling**: date-fns
- **Form Validation**: yup or zod
- **Network Info**: @react-native-community/netinfo

#### Phase 3-4 (UI/UX)
- **Animations**: react-native-reanimated
- **Gestures**: react-native-gesture-handler
- **Safe Area**: react-native-safe-area-context
- **Screens**: react-native-screens
- **SVG**: react-native-svg (for custom graphics)
- **Image Picker**: expo-image-picker
- **Image Manipulation**: expo-image-manipulator

#### Phase 5 (Premium)
- **In-App Purchases**: RevenueCat SDK
- **File System**: expo-file-system
- **Media Library**: expo-media-library
- **Haptics**: expo-haptics

#### Phase 6-7 (Polish & Launch)
- **Updates**: expo-updates (OTA updates)
- **Linking**: expo-linking (deep links)
- **Splash Screen**: expo-splash-screen
- **App Loading**: expo-app-loading
- **Sentry**: @sentry/react-native (error tracking)

### Services & APIs

#### Required External Services
1. **Firebase Project**
   - Authentication
   - Firestore Database
   - Cloud Storage
   - Cloud Functions
   - Cloud Messaging

2. **Apple Developer Account**
   - App Store Connect
   - Push Notification Certificates
   - TestFlight

3. **RevenueCat Account**
   - Subscription management
   - Receipt validation

4. **Domain & Email**
   - typeb.app domain
   - support@typeb.app email

### Potential Missing Pieces

#### Should Consider
1. **Email Service** (for notifications beyond push)
   - SendGrid or AWS SES
   - For email verification, password reset

2. **Background Tasks**
   - expo-background-fetch
   - For syncing when app is closed

3. **Calendar Integration** (Future)
   - expo-calendar
   - react-native-calendar-events

4. **Biometric Auth**
   - expo-local-authentication

5. **Share Functionality**
   - expo-sharing
   - React Native Share

#### Infrastructure Considerations
1. **CDN for Assets**
   - CloudFlare or Firebase Hosting

2. **Monitoring**
   - Datadog or New Relic (when scaling)

3. **A/B Testing**
   - Firebase Remote Config (already planned)
   - Or Optimizely

4. **Customer Support**
   - Intercom or Zendesk (post-launch)

## DEPENDENCY TRACKING TEMPLATE

```typescript
/**
 * DEPENDENCY: Notification System
 * Required by: Task Creation
 * Implemented in: Phase 4
 * 
 * Current stub implementation:
 * - Returns mock success
 * - Logs to console in dev
 * 
 * Integration test: src/features/tasks/tests/notification.integration.test.ts
 * 
 * CHECKPOINT: End of Phase 4 - Must be fully integrated
 */
async function scheduleNotification(task: Task): Promise<void> {
  if (__DEV__) {
    console.log('STUB: Would schedule notification for', task.id);
    return Promise.resolve();
  }
  // Real implementation in Phase 4
}
```

## CONSISTENCY ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

### Daily Ritual
```bash
# Start of session
1. git pull
2. Read MASTER-TRACKER.md
3. Read development-standards.md
4. Check zero-tech-debt-policy.md
5. Review current phase in tracker

# During development
- Reference standards before each major decision
- Check design system for UI work
- Verify analytics events are tracked

# End of session
1. Run tests
2. Update MASTER-TRACKER.md
3. Check for tech debt
4. Commit with proper message format
5. Push to git
```

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "Let's just do this for now"
- "We can refactor later"
- "This is temporary"
- "Good enough for MVP"
- "We'll add tests later"

**Remember: MVP doesn't mean Minimum Viable Product, it means Most Valuable Product - built right from the start.**

## ENFORCEMENT COMMITMENT

I commit to:
1. Check standards docs before every major decision
2. Never introduce tech debt
3. Complete each phase to production quality
4. Track all dependencies explicitly
5. Reference our established patterns consistently
6. Alert you if something would create debt

You should:
1. Call out any deviation from standards
2. Reject any "temporary" solutions
3. Ensure I'm checking documentation
4. Verify no tech debt at phase end

**This is our quality contract. No exceptions.**
