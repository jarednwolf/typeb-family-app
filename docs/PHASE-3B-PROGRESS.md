## 📝 Code Quality Notes

### What's Working Well
- Clean component structure
- Good separation of concerns
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Consistent styling approach

### Areas for Improvement
- Need base component for shared props
- Could use custom hooks for data fetching
- Animation performance needs attention
- Test coverage still at 0%
