# TypeB Family App - Testing Infrastructure Plan

**Purpose**: Establish robust testing to ensure app reliability and security  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must be done before app store submission

## Current Testing Reality Check

### What We Have (The Problem)
- 141 tests that all pass (100% pass rate)
- BUT: Tests are testing mocks, not real behavior
- 0% UI component test coverage
- 0% integration tests with real Firebase
- No E2E tests
- Security vulnerabilities untested

### What We Need (The Solution)
- Real tests using Firebase emulators
- UI component tests with user interactions
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Security penetration testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Phase 1: Firebase Emulator Setup (Days 1-3)

  describe('Creating a task', () => {
    beforeEach(async () => {
      await clearTestData();
      await seedTestFamily();
    });

    it('should create task with valid data', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const user = await createTestUser({ role: 'parent' });
      
      // Act
      const task = await taskService.createTask({...});
      
      // Assert
      expect(task).toBeDefined();
      expect(task.title).toBe('Test Task');
    });
  });
});
```

### Coverage Requirements

- [ ] All security vulnerabilities tested
- [ ] E2E tests for all critical paths
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running all tests
- [ ] Zero flaky tests
- [ ] Test execution < 10 minutes

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't test implementation details** - Test behavior
2. **Don't ignore flaky tests** - Fix them immediately
3. **Don't skip error cases** - They're most important
4. **Don't mock everything** - Use real services
5. **Don't forget cleanup** - Reset state between tests
