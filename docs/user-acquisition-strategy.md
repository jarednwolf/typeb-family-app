### Reddit Post Template
```
Title: [Specific to subreddit]

Hey [subreddit],

I'm a parent of a Type B teenager who forgets everything. Sound familiar?

I got tired of the constant nagging and built an app that:
- Sends smart reminders (that actually work)
- Lets parents assign tasks without confrontation  
- Helps teens build habits gradually
- Tracks everything so no more "I forgot"

Looking for 20 beta testers (parents OR teens). It's free during beta, and you'll get premium features free for helping.

Not trying to sell anything - genuinely want feedback to make this useful.

Comment if interested and I'll DM the TestFlight link!
