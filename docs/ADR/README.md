# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains decisions that shape the architecture and tech stack.

- 000-template.md — Use this to author new ADRs
- 001-monorepo-structure.md — Monorepo with pnpm + turbo
- 002-firebase-backend.md — Firebase chosen for backend

Conventions:
- One decision per file, immutable after Accepted; use Superseded status to replace
- Status values: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded
- Keep concise and actionable; link to deeper docs when needed
