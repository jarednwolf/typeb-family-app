### E2E Tests Needed

## Premium Gates Implementation

All premium features are properly gated using the `PremiumGate` component:

Free users see upgrade prompts with clear value propositions.

## Database Schema Updates

### Collections Modified

- `tasks`: Added validation fields (`validationStatus`, `photoValidatedBy`, `validationNotes`)
- `notificationRules`: New collection for custom notification rules

## Performance Considerations

- Analytics calculations are memoized for performance
- Photo uploads use Firebase Storage with size optimization
- Notification scheduling uses batch operations
- Real-time updates use Firestore listeners efficiently
