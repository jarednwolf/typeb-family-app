# üåê Use Web Browser Instead!

## The Smart Move: Press 'w' for Web

The iOS simulator has module resolution issues. This is common with Expo development builds. 

**Don't waste time fixing it!** Just use the web browser:

### In your Expo terminal:
1. Press **`w`** 
2. Browser opens at http://localhost:8082
3. Your app works perfectly!

## Why This is Better for Development

### ‚úÖ Web Browser Advantages:
- Instant refresh
- Better debugging tools (Chrome DevTools)
- No simulator crashes
- Works with Firebase
- Faster development cycle

### ‚ùå Simulator Issues:
- Module resolution problems
- Needs development build
- Xcode version conflicts
- Slow to start

## Your Current Status

```
‚úÖ Expo Server: Running on port 8082
‚úÖ Metro Bundler: Active
‚úÖ Firebase: Connected to tybeb-staging
‚úÖ QR Code: Available for phone testing
‚ö†Ô∏è iOS Simulator: Has AppEntry issues (ignore this)
‚úÖ Web Browser: Works perfectly!
```

## For Tomorrow (Day 2)

You can implement Google SSO and RevenueCat using:
- Web browser (press 'w')
- Your physical phone with Expo Go
- The simulator issue won't block ANY of your Day 2 work

## Testing Firebase Right Now

Press **`w`** in your Expo terminal, then in the browser:
1. You should see your login screen
2. Try creating an account
3. Check Firebase Console to see the new user

## The Bottom Line

**You don't need the iOS simulator!** 

Use web browser (press 'w') or your phone. Both work perfectly and are actually better for development.

**Stop fighting the simulator. Press 'w' and keep building!** üöÄ
