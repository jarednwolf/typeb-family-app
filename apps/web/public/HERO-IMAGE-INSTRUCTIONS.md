# Hero Image Setup Instructions

## The Issue
The hero image doesn't appear because we created a text placeholder instead of saving the actual image file.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Save the Image Directly
1. Save your hero image to: `apps/web/public/hero-image.jpg`
2. Make sure it's the actual image file (JPG, PNG, etc.), not a text file

### Option 2: Use a Different Image
If you want to use a different image or the one you provided earlier:
1. Copy your image file to `apps/web/public/`
2. Name it `hero-image.jpg` (or update the component to use the correct filename)

### Option 3: Use a Stock Image Temporarily
For testing, you can use this Unsplash URL directly in the component:
```jsx
src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[photo-id]"
```

## Once the Image is Added

The hero section will automatically display it with:
- Rounded corners
- Shadow effect
- Floating UI elements overlaid
- Responsive sizing

## Image Recommendations
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Dimensions**: At least 1200x900px for good quality
- **File Size**: Optimize to under 500KB for web performance
- **Content**: Shows someone using a phone/device (matches the family app theme)

## Quick Test
After adding the image, run:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```
Then visit http://localhost:3000 to see the updated hero section.
