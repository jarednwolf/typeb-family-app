# TypeB Family App - Launch Q&A

## Your Specific Questions Answered

### 1. Should I rebuild the iOS app now or wait?

**Answer: YES, rebuild now!** ✅
- We've already started the rebuild (Build #12) which is currently in progress
- The rebuild was necessary because Apple requires iOS 18 SDK as of April 24, 2025
- Your previous build (#8) was rejected from TestFlight for using an older SDK
- The new build includes fixes for the RevenueCat SubscriptionPeriod issue

**Current Status:**
- Build #12 is running now (started at 9:26 PM MST)
- Monitor progress at: https://expo.dev/accounts/wolfjn1/projects/typeb-family-app/builds/ff9f6ac8-f48a-4991-b1fa-942030ff28e6
- Expected completion: ~20-30 minutes

### 2. How do I create an app-specific password for TestFlight submission?

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Go to Apple ID website:**
   - Visit: https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage
   - Sign in with: wolfjn1@gmail.com

2. **Navigate to Security:**
   - Click on "Sign-In and Security"
   - Look for "App-Specific Passwords" section

3. **Generate New Password:**
   - Click the "+" button or "Generate Password"
   - Enter a label: "EAS Submit" or "TypeB TestFlight"
   - Click "Create"

4. **Save the Password:**

   - Save it securely (you won't see it again)
   - Format: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

5. **Use During Submission:**
   ```bash
   eas submit --platform ios --latest
   ```
   - When prompted for Apple ID: wolfjn1@gmail.com
   - When prompted for password: Use the app-specific password (NOT your regular password)

### 3. What's the best strategy for beta testing?

**Recommended Beta Testing Strategy:**

#### Phase 1: Internal Testing (Days 1-3)
- **Who:** You and immediate family
- **Focus:** Core functionality, critical bugs
- **Group Size:** 3-5 testers
- **Duration:** 2-3 days

#### Phase 2: Friends & Family (Days 4-7)
- **Who:** Close friends with kids, extended family
- **Focus:** Usability, onboarding flow
- **Group Size:** 10-15 testers
- **Duration:** 3-4 days

#### Phase 3: Public Beta (Week 2)
- **Who:** Target audience (parents with children)
- **Focus:** Feature validation, performance
- **Group Size:** 50-100 testers
- **Duration:** 1 week

**TestFlight Setup:**
1. Create groups:
   - "Internal Team" (immediate access)
   - "Friends & Family" (invite only)
   - "Public Beta" (public link)

2. Feedback collection:
   - Use TestFlight's built-in feedback
   - Create a feedback form: Google Forms or Typeform
   - Set up a dedicated email: feedback@typeb.app

3. Key metrics to track:
   - Crash rate
   - Session length
   - Feature usage
   - Conversion to premium

### 4. Should I start the Android build while iOS is processing?

**Answer: Wait for iOS to complete first** ⏸️

**Reasons:**
1. **Focus on one platform:** Ensure iOS build succeeds before starting Android
2. **Learn from iOS issues:** Any build issues can be fixed before Android
3. **Resource management:** EAS build queues can handle one at a time better
4. **Sequential validation:** Test iOS on TestFlight first, then build Android

**Recommended Timeline:**
- Tonight: Complete iOS build and submit to TestFlight
- Tomorrow morning: Start Android build
- Tomorrow afternoon: Submit Android to Google Play

**Android Build Command (for tomorrow):**
```bash
cd typeb-family-app
eas build --platform android --profile production
```
