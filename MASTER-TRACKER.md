## üìù Session Notes

### January 8, 2025 - Data Scheme Fixes
- Fixed Redux state access patterns throughout the app
  - Changed all `state.auth.user` references to `state.auth.userProfile`
  - Updated files: CreateFamilyScreen, JoinFamilyScreen, FamilyScreen, CreateTaskModal, SettingsScreen, TaskDetailModal
  - Fixed `selectCurrentUserRole` selector to use userProfile instead of user.uid
- Fixed "Missing or insufficient permissions" error when creating families
  - Root cause: Transaction-based reads in `generateInviteCode` function causing permission issues
  - Solution 1: Removed transaction parameter from `generateInviteCode` to avoid transaction read limitations
  - Solution 2: Updated Firestore rules to allow additional fields during user creation
  - Successfully deployed updated Firestore rules
- Identified remaining issues:
  - Date serialization is properly handled in Redux slices
  - Need to verify all data models match DATA-STANDARDS-AND-CONVENTIONS.md
  - Need to test family creation flow end-to-end

### January 8, 2025 - Production Readiness Assessment
- Completed comprehensive review of codebase
- Identified app is 91% production ready (much better than January 6-7 assessment)
- Created 3-week sprint plan to production
- Decided on hybrid approach: fix critical issues, then UI, then complete backend
- Updated master tracker with detailed checklist
