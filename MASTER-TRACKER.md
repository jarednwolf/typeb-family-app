## 🔄 GIT & DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Git Push Strategy
**Frequency**: Every 2 hours OR at feature completion
- Commit after each small feature works
- Push when tests pass
- Never leave uncommitted code > 2 hours
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`

### Branch Strategy (Simple for Speed)
```
main (production-ready code only)
└── develop (active development)
    └── current working branch
```

### Environment Strategy
**Start Simple**: Single Firebase project for now
- Use same Firebase for dev and early beta
- Add staging environment only when we have paying users
- Production environment after App Store approval

**Firebase Project Structure**:
```
typeb-app (single project initially)
├── Development (local testing)
├── Beta (TestFlight users)
└── Production (App Store - create later)
```

### Deployment Triggers
- **Local Dev**: On every save (Expo hot reload)
- **Beta (TestFlight)**: After each phase completion
- **Production**: After App Store approval
